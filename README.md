Tuberculosis Detection using Chest X-Ray
The usefulness of transfer learning on medical imaging for the purpose of tuberculosis detection. We show an improved method for transfer 
learning over the regular method of using ImageNet weights. We also discover that the low-level features from ImageNet weights are
not useful for imaging tasks for modalities like X-rays andalso propose a new method for obtaining low level features by training the
models in a multiclass multilabel scenario.The output is visualized in the FIgure below:
